# 4. Log Management Best Practices
## 4.1 Proactive Log Management
So now, we come to the next point, which is proactive log management. This is where building at adapting proactive capabilities can help sharpen the knife for SOC teams 
- to widen the log original sensible way, 
- to spot and remove  irrelevant log sources to open up capacity, 
- to identify new log sources against new TTPs with no delay, 
- to identify shortcomings that can affect the flow of data.

To gain capabilities for being proactive,our proposition is making the threat-centric validation part of log management processes. 

Suppose an attack simulation can provide a large set of threat samples, automation, and rich context about how the network response to the simulations. In that case, this insight can be used to pinpoint login gaps on SIEMs and opens up the road to fixing them.

We come across quite often that log management involves a lot of assumptions; those assumptions mislead SIEM admins that logs are collected alright,  and they have the required details. In most cases, logging problems are identified after an incident takes place.

## 4.2 Proactively Validate Log Status for a Particular Threat
So now, we will explore five best practices for proactive log management. In this last section of the course, I want to share with you five threat-centric validation best practices through which SIEM admins can identify the logging shortcomings themselves before an incident occurs.

The first best practice is validating log status for a particular threat or an adversary group. It aims to help identify whether a SIEM platform has the required log visibility against a new TTP or TTPs. For example, a SOC analyst may want to check if the SIEM would receive logs related to Lazarus Group's latest attack campaign TTPs if an actual attack took place. 

Suppose that an attack scenario of the Lazarus group contains 12 unique actions. It starts with system information discovery and continues with system network configuration discovery, system network connections discovery and goes all the way to C2 over HTTPS port 443. Using an integrated attack simulation platform, security analysts can safely replicate Lazarus Group's malicious actions, identify which of them are detected and missed, and mirror these findings to the SIEM platform to see whether everything matches or there are log visibility gaps that need addressing.
