# 4. Log Management Best Practices
## 4.1 Proactive Log Management
So now, we come to the next point, which is proactive log management. This is where building at adapting proactive capabilities can help sharpen the knife for SOC teams 
- to widen the log original sensible way, 
- to spot and remove  irrelevant log sources to open up capacity, 
- to identify new log sources against new TTPs with no delay, 
- to identify shortcomings that can affect the flow of data.

To gain capabilities for being proactive,our proposition is making the threat-centric validation part of log management processes. 

Suppose an attack simulation can provide a large set of threat samples, automation, and rich context about how the network response to the simulations. In that case, this insight can be used to pinpoint login gaps on SIEMs and opens up the road to fixing them.

We come across quite often that log management involves a lot of assumptions; those assumptions mislead SIEM admins that logs are collected alright,  and they have the required details. In most cases, logging problems are identified after an incident takes place.

## 4.2 Proactively Validate Log Status for a Particular Threat
So now, we will explore five best practices for proactive log management. In this last section of the course, I want to share with you five threat-centric validation best practices through which SIEM admins can identify the logging shortcomings themselves before an incident occurs.

The first best practice is validating log status for a particular threat or an adversary group. It aims to help identify whether a SIEM platform has the required log visibility against a new TTP or TTPs. For example, a SOC analyst may want to check if the SIEM would receive logs related to Lazarus Group's latest attack campaign TTPs if an actual attack took place. 

Suppose that an attack scenario of the Lazarus group contains 12 unique actions. It starts with system information discovery and continues with system network configuration discovery, system network connections discovery and goes all the way to C2 over HTTPS port 443. Using an integrated attack simulation platform, security analysts can safely replicate Lazarus Group's malicious actions, identify which of them are detected and missed, and mirror these findings to the SIEM platform to see whether everything matches or there are log visibility gaps that need addressing.

## 4.3 Look for Detection Opportunities in Your Security Stack
The second best practice is related to the detection capabilities of the security stack, which can be Network IPS, WAF, Firewall, endpoint protection, and other defense technologies. 

In a scenario where a threat is not detected on the defense level, no logs are generated ,and the SOC teams have no way of knowing what type of malicious events that particular threat may be generating in the network.

The best practice we suggest here is: 
-as the first step, frequently or continuously simulate a comprehensive set of threats across the security stack
- the second step is to identify detection gaps on the security stack based on these simulations. These first two steps reveal thread activities that security teams would not know if that threat is used in an actual attack.

## 4.4 Look for Detection Opportunities in Your Infrastructure
For this best practice, simulate an attack first. If the simulation has not been detected, the log source of the TTP used in the simulation can be identified and enabled on the endpoint platform. 

Here on the slide as an example, you can see that the recent Hafnium campaign targeting MS Exchange platforms can be detected if PowerShell Script Block Logging is enabled.

## 4.5 Visualize to Better Understand, Manage, Communicate, and Coordinate
The fourth best practice aims to put logging performance in a context, for example, the MITRE ATT&CK framework. 

By identifying the MITRE ATT&CK techniques where no logs are received based on attack simulations, security teams can take corrective actions, identify gaps against the new threats or variance and monitor positive and negative log coverage changes.

## 4.6 Proactively Identifying Missing Logs due to Delievery, Collection Or Configuration Changes
The last best practice aims at identifying and fixing log delivery and collection problems. 

In this best practice, security controls detected or prevented an attack, generated logs, but due to configuration mistakes, network related delays, API limitations, changes made by the IT teams, and other possible reasons, the SIEM may not have received the log.

The best practice we suggest is to continually or frequently running attack simulations using an extensive threat sample database to address these types of infrastructural problems. Then, you can determine the delta between how security controls responded and what the SIEM has seen and establishing a regular validation process. 

While previous use cases aim to optimize and widen logging coverage proactively, this best practice aims to keep this optimized login infrastructure up and running.

## 4.7 Threat-Centric Log Validation with Picus
Given the complexity of the log management function, SOC practitioners have to deal with all combinations of failures involving malfunctioning log sources, invalid log format, or temporary service disruption while adapting the scope of log collection to the changing adversarial landscape. 

Besides many other features, Picus Security Control Validation Platform offers a threat-centric log validation process that allows SOC teams to proactively and consciously address these challenges by identifying: 
- links between logging gaps and attack techniques
- problems with originating or transferring logs
- challenges in identifying log sources and level of verbose. 

This brings me to the end of this course. Thank you for your attention.

## 4.8 Next Steps
Now, you've seen all the content of the course, so you can take the certification exam. 

You will be allowed three attempts to pass the exam. If you were able to successfully complete the exam with a minimum score of 80%, you will get an email from Purple Academy that includes a link to your digital credentials. These credentials are similar to the badges you see on LinkedIn. They are also verifiable and linked to your name and email address.
